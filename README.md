## Future Development
I would like to make multiple stages of this. I think it would be fun. Had a bit of a family crisis that stopped me from working on this for a while so I was going to do more work for the original deadline but was quickly swamped by 16 billion other things. Still very proud of the product. As someone who's never done pixel art before I was pleasently surprised on how much I enjoyed it.
